        we don't think about it after closing the trash lid. How much trash do you throw away
        each day? Have you ever thought about where it all goes?"

        do you ever think about how your food got into your hands? Food provides
        the nutrients that fuel our bodies and nourishes our minds, but they're not
        all created equal. How they're grown influences how much nutrients you get."

        we put on it? When buying bodycare products, we're probably looking for products

        to read what's in the ingredient list? And even then, do you know what the ingredients are? "

        (0.5% of that 70%, to be exact) is available for us to use and consume. To make sure everyone
        has equitable access, we have to be mindful of our water use. It's going to take more than just
        turning off the faucet and showering for shorter periods of time."

        and touch (like your bed, your chair, your desk) matter. This physical contact with things in our home
