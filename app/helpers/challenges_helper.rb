            Food packaging, in particular, extends food's shelf life and makes it convenient for us to shop at grocery stores,

            shop without the packaging and still get the food we need. Many grocery stores also sell loose produce; just be
            sure to skip the plastic bag. The first of the 5R's is to reduce. If we avoid the packaging to begin with, we don't

            the food they touch (think: to-go food containers and utensils). When the plastics from to-go foodware and packaging are trashed,
            many of them end up in our oceans where marine life mistake the colorful plastics for food. In fact, it is estimated that by 2050,
            there will be more plastic than fish in the oceans. Plastic does not biodegrade on land or in water. However, light degrades this
            plastic both on land and in water, breaking the material down into smaller and smaller pieces over time. These microplastics can
            absorb the chemicals in its surrounding areas so much that a small piece of plastic can be thousands of times more toxic than its
            surrounding area. When animals, especially fish, eat these microplastics, they make their way up the food chain into our food supply.
